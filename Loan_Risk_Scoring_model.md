Project Overview

This project builds a simple loan risk model using borrower information. The goal was to create a basic scoring system, analyze patterns, and visualize how different factors relate to loan risk.

1. What I Did
Cleaned and prepared loan data

Built a simple risk score using Excel formulas

Created pivot tables and charts to explore patterns

Identified which borrower characteristics were linked to higher risk 

Identified the factors that were relevant in predicting risk category

2. Key Insights
Certain factors like high DTI or low credit score were associated with higher risk

Visualizations helped show how risk levels differ across age groups and income ranges

i. Analysis of Risk Category Distribution across Age groups chart 

    -The breakdown of high, medium, and low risk borrowers is nearly identical for every age group shown (18-27 up to 68-77). Age is not a determining factor for assigned borrower's risk category .

    - The High Risk category is the largest segment, making up approximately 50% of the borrowers in every age bracket.The Medium Risk category accounts for the remainder of the balance, around 48-49%, while lower Risk Category accounts for just about 2%.

    Overall, the data suggests that in this portfolio, age is not a predictor of a borrower's assigned risk category.

ii. Analysis of Risk Category Distribution by DTI points

    -Borrowers with 0 DTI points are almost exclusively marked as High Risk.
    -As borrowers earn 5 or 10 DTI points, the High Risk classification nearly disappears and the Medium Risk category dominates.

    Higher DTI scores means safer borrowers, which strongly reduces the chance of being labeled as high risk.

iii. Analysis of Risk Category distribution by Credit points

    - Borrowers without credit experience, that is 0 are overwhelmingly High Risk (about 72% of the group).
    - For those with 5 points of credit experience, the proportion of High Risk borrowers drops dramatically (to about 44%), and the Medium Risk category becomes the largest group.

    In cocnlusion, having more credit experience strongly correlates with a lower high-risk classification.


3. Tools Used
Excel (formulas, pivot tables, charts)

4. What I Learned
How to design a simple risk model

How to interpret patterns in borrower data

How to present findings clearly and visually
