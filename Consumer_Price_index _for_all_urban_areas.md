Project Overview

This project analyzes US inflation trends using CPI (Consumer Price Index) data. The goal was to clean the dataset, build clear visualizations, and explain how inflation changed over time.

1. What I Did
Cleaned and organized CPI data in Excel

Built line charts to show inflation trends

Calculated month‑to‑month and year‑to‑year changes

Summarized key insights in simple language

2. Key Insights
Identified periods of rising and falling inflation

Highlighted major trend shifts

Explained the overall direction of inflation during the selected period

Detailed analaysis
  - The CPI consistent increase from 1947 to 2025 reflecting steady inflation overtime
  - A noticeable inflection occurs around 1991 where the rate of increase becomes steeper
  - An unusual deep ossurs in 2021, likely linked to the paandemic-related economic shock 
  - By 2025, CPI reaches approximately 320, marking a significant increase from pre pandemic levels. 
  - Between the late 1960s and early 1980s, the CPI rises much faster than in the decades before it. It’s the steepest climb before the recent 2021–2025 surge.
  - The CPI rises overtime, but not at thesame speed, it's almost like the shift happens within a 30 year period. From 1947 to around 1980 prices increase slow steadily.
  - After 1980, there was a sharp jump, followed by another period of steady growth from about 1990 to 2020. Starting in 2021, inflation increased much faster, creatinga steep rise. By 2025 CPI reaches roughly 320,showing how much faster prices have grown in the most recent years.
