# Portfolio Overview

This portfolio showcases three practical data projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Each project focuses on solving a real‑world problem using clear methods and simple, interpretable results.

1. US Inflation Analysis (Excel)
A time‑series analysis of CPI data to understand how inflation changes over time.
I cleaned the dataset, built clear visual charts, and summarized key economic trends in simple language.
This project highlights my ability to work with real economic data and communicate insights clearly.

2. Loan Risk Scoring Model (Excel + Python)
A basic credit‑risk model that assigns risk levels to borrowers based on financial characteristics.
I created a simple scoring system, used pivot tables and charts to explore patterns, and identified factors linked to higher loan risk.
This project demonstrates practical risk analysis and data visualization skills.

3. Loan Default Prediction Model (Machine Learning)
A classification model built to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan.
I cleaned the data, selected key features, trained a Random Forest model, handled class imbalance with SMOTE, and evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1‑score.
This project reflects real‑world challenges in credit‑risk modeling and shows my ability to build and interpret machine‑learning models.
